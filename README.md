# odin-recipes
 A Brief Introduction

 What will I be learning from this exprience? Gaining the skills needed to become a better programmer. 
 I hope to achieve a good work skill for myself and achieve things I thought I could never imagine. 
 Put my mind to it and work till I make it to the top of The Odin Project and see myself work with other developers. 
 Inshallah.
