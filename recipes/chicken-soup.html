        <p>"This was the best recipe and so easy to make," says Kathleen Stahl. "I made a double batch and used some of the chicken and broth to make a homemade chicken pot pie and it was so yummy!"

            "This has always been my go-to favorite soup during the cooler winter months," says another Allrecipes community member.

            "It's also perfect for my toddler when he's not feeling well. The only thing I do differently is roast the veggies and chicken in the oven with a generous coating of olive oil and seasonings before putting it in the pot."
            "Wonderful soup," according to Laurie Varner. "I also cooked orzo pasta separately and added it to the soup. You can also sprinkle some Parmesan cheese too!

            <li>Chicken: This homemade chicken soup starts with a 3-pound whole chicken.</li>

            <li>Seasonings: Simply season the soup with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon granules (if you want).</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the stock by boiling the chicken and veggies until the meat is falling off the bone.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken and cut into pieces (discard skin and bones).</li>
            <li>Strain the vegetables (reserving the stock) and cut into pieces. Rinse the pot.</li>
