        <hi>Biryani</hi>

        <p>You’ll find variations of Biryani all across the Indian subcontinent,
             from Pakistan to Bangladesh, Afghanistan to India.
              There are 2 main types – one where the protein 
              and/or vegetables are cooked mixed throughout the rice, and the other version known as Hyderabad-style biryani in India where meat and rice are layered and cook in a sealed pot over fire. The latter is the style of biryani I’m sharing today.
        </p>

        <p>There’s a wonderful Afghani restaurant in my area called Sahar 
            (Newport, Sydney) which serves a Biryani that’s a huge favourite among locals.
             Hands down, the best ethnic restaurant I know in the upper northern beaches.
