        <h2>A loving dish of Biryani</h2>
        <p>You’ll find variations of Biryani all across the Indian subcontinent,
             from Pakistan to Bangladesh, Afghanistan to India.
              There are 2 main types – one where the protein 
              and/or vegetables are cooked mixed throughout the rice, and the other version known as Hyderabad-style biryani in India where meat and rice are layered and cook in a sealed pot over fire. The latter is the style of biryani I’m sharing today.
        </p>

        <p>There’s a wonderful Afghani restaurant in my area called Sahar 
            (Newport, Sydney) which serves a Biryani that’s a huge favourite among locals.
             Hands down, the best ethnic restaurant I know in the upper northern beaches.

            <li>Spices for chicken</li>
            <li>4 Sliced onions</li>

        <h2>How to make the Biryani</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Place basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.

            </li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks and cook in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onions; cook and stir until onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic paste and ginger paste into onion mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle cilantro and mint over onion mixture and cook 1 minute more.

            </li>
            <li>Stir in tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper; continue cooking until oil begins to separate from the sauce, about 10 minutes. Add yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add some water as needed to keep mixture from getting too dry.

            </li>
            <li>Layer about ½ of the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala mixture over the rice. Spread fried onion over lamb masala. Top with remaining rice

            </li>
            <li>Stir saffron and warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.

            </li>
        </ul>
